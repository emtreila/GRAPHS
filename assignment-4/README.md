# ðŸ“… Project Scheduling & Critical Path Analysis

This Python project analyzes a list of activities with durations and prerequisites to:

-  Verify if the corresponding graph is a **DAG** (Directed Acyclic Graph)
-  Perform **topological sorting** using the **predecessor counter algorithm**
-  Calculate **earliest and latest start times** for all activities
-  Identify the **critical path** and **critical activities**
-  Print the **total duration** of the project
