# Directed Graph ADT 

This project implements a **Directed Graph Abstract Data Type (ADT)** in Python. It provides a clean object-oriented design for working with graphs, including vertex and edge operations, and supports reading from and writing to text files.

The graph:
- Uses integers (`0` to `n-1`) as vertex labels.
- Represents edges as pairs of vertices with an associated integer cost.
- Supports modification of the graph structure (adding/removing vertices and edges).

A simple console-based UI is also included to interact with the graph.

## Features

- **Graph Operations**  
  - Get the number of vertices.  
  - Add or remove vertices and edges.  
  - Check if an edge exists between two vertices.  
  - Retrieve or modify the cost of an edge.  
  - Get in-degree and out-degree of vertices.  

- **Parsing and Iteration**  
  - Iterate over all vertices.  
  - Iterate over inbound and outbound edges of a vertex.  

- **File I/O**  
  - Read a directed graph from a text file.  
  - Write the current graph to a text file.  

- **Utilities**  
  - Generate random graphs with a specified number of vertices and edges.  
  - Copy an existing graph (deep copy).
